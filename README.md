# CodeX
<h4> The lightweight editor</h4>
The code is heavy on dependencies at present, will move to removing all uneccessary paths in the file.

A terminal code editor that we tried to build using C++. Great learning experience with editors, understanding how they work, how the Linux terminal works and more.

This was no Vim or Emacs, but t'was a good attempt, especially when it we got syntax highlighting up.
